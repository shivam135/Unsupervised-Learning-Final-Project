# Unsupervised Learning Final Project

This repository contains the code and dataset for an unsupervised learning project on jellyfish species classification.

## Dataset

- The `data/` folder contains images of different jellyfish species (format: JPEG/PNG).
- Ensure the images are placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook (`jellyfish.ipynb`)

- `jellyfish.ipynb` contains the Python code for preprocessing the dataset and applying unsupervised learning techniques for classification.
- **Configuration:** Update the directory path in the notebook to point to the `data/` directory where your images are located.

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Install the necessary dependencies (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.) using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed.
- Place the dataset images in the `data/` directory.
- Open and run `jellyfish.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
